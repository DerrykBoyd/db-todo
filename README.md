# dboydgit To-Do

**dboydgit To-Do** is a real time syncing To-Do list progressive web application, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The lastest version of the app uses [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a serverless backend.

You can see the app in production at [https://dboydgit-to-do.web.app](https://dboydgit-to-do.web.app)

#### To-Do with PouchDB

A previous version of this application was built with a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) backend and used [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) to store and sync data. The backend was hosted on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet and deployment was managed with continuous integration through [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

The previous version can still be viewed at [https://db-todo.duckdns.org](https://db-todo.duckdns.org)
